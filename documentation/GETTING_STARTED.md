# Getting Started with Neetings Development

This guide helps new developers get up and running with the Neetings codebase
quickly and efficiently.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - For version control
- **VS Code** (recommended) - With TypeScript and ESLint extensions

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/simonneutert/neetings.git
cd neeting-jsx

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) - you should see the Neetings app
running!

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests (should pass 196+ tests)
npm test

# Check code quality
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 📚 Understanding the Codebase

### What is Neetings?

Neetings is a **local-first meeting management platform** that transforms
chaotic meeting notes into organized, actionable outcomes. All data is stored in
your browser's localStorage - no backend required.

### Core Concepts (5-minute read)

1. **Meetings** - Containers for all meeting content
2. **Blocks** - Individual content items (11 types: Note, Q&A, Research, etc.)
3. **Topic Groups** - Kanban columns that organize blocks
4. **Attendees** - Global registry of meeting participants

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) (3kB React alternative) with
  TypeScript
- **Build**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with hot module replacement
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) +
  [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) (196+ tests)
- **State**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Drag & Drop**: [@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) for Kanban functionality
- **Schema**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for data validation

## 🎯 Your First Tasks

### 1. Explore the App

- Create a new meeting
- Add different block types (Note, TODO, Decision, etc.)
- Switch between List and Kanban views
- Try drag & drop functionality
- Export a meeting to see the output

### 2. Run the Tests

```bash
# Full test suite
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Interactive test UI
npm run test:ui
```
