## Data Sensitivity Notice

**Neetings is designed for local data storage.** All meeting content is stored in your browser's localStorage, ensuring privacy and control. No backend servers are used, so your data remains on your device.

### 🎯 **Perfect For**
- **Team Leads** managing multiple project discussions
- **Product Managers** tracking decisions across features
- **Consultants** organizing client meetings and follow-ups
- **Agile Teams** running sprint planning and retrospectives
- **Anyone** tired of messy, unstructured meeting notes

## ✨ What Makes Neetings Different

### 🧱 **11 Smart Block Types**
Stop fighting with generic text boxes. Each content type gets its own intelligent block:

| 📝 **Notes** | 💡 **Ideas** | ✅ **Decisions** | ⚠️ **Issues** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Context & background | Brainstorming concepts | Final resolutions | Problems & blockers |

| ☑️ **TODOs** | 🎯 **Goals** | 📋 **Follow-ups** | 🔬 **Research** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Action items | Strategic objectives | Next meeting actions | Investigation findings |

| 💡 **Facts** | ❓ **Q&A** | 📚 **References** |
|---|---|---|
| Key data points | Discussion clarifications | External resources |

### 🗂️ **Kanban View That Makes Sense**
Switch from linear notes to **visual topic columns** instantly. Drag and drop blocks between topics, reorder priorities, and see your meeting structure at a glance.

### 👥 **Attendee Management Done Right**
- **Global attendee registry** with smart autocomplete
- **Flexible email handling** - email addresses are optional for maximum flexibility
- **Visual participation tracking** across all meetings
- **One-click assignment** with duplicate prevention
- **Meeting attendance statistics** to track engagement
- **Safe search functionality** that handles attendees with or without email addresses

### 🔍 **Find Anything, Instantly**
