        "answer": "Stop fighting with generic text boxes! Neetings provides 11 specialized block types (Stories, TODOs, Decisions, Issues, etc.) that understand your meeting content. Plus, instant Kanban view, smart attendee tracking, and powerful filtering - all running 100% in your browser with zero setup."

      "organization": {
        "question": "Can I organize complex meetings effectively?",
        "answer": "Yes! Switch to Kanban view to organize blocks into topic columns. Drag and drop between topics as discussions evolve. Use advanced filtering to find specific content types, completion status, or date ranges. Perfect for multi-topic meetings and sprint planning."
      },
      "attendees": {
        "question": "How does attendee management work?",
